                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>Part of my joy in learning is that it puts me in a position to teach; nothing, however outstanding and however helpful, will ever give me any pleasure if the knowledge is to be for my benefit alone. If wisdom were offered to me on the one condition that I should keep it shifted away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the possession of  anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with." - Seneca</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> Because of the recent fallback of the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools, colleges and universities have moved towards digital and remote learning. Most institutions use the help of products like Zoom to facilitate communication and replicate the classroom environment. Many studies, including the user study that we performed, have shown that applications like Zoom are not preffered by many students and do not effectively replicate the traditional classroom environment. Our goal is to create a system that encourages students and instuctors to use all the features that these applications contain to achieve the best digital learning experience that is the most similar to their regular classroom. </p>

            <h3> Development Process</h3>

            <p> We started our development by brainstorming new features that we could add to a Zoom type platform. We then reached the consensus of adding a few features like chat reactions, games, whiteboard as well as a reward system. To represent and complete a prototype we made a p5.js mockup which replicated actions like reacting to a message and playing a game. You can see our Zoom prototype below and play around with our p5.js mockup.<p>
